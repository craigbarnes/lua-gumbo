This has since been removed from the makefile, but it's worth noting
that it wasn't the right solution, even when this commit was created.

The correct solution would have been to put $(LDLIBS) *after* the list
of object files in the linker command-line, so that the "--as-needed"
option (which is the default on Ubuntu) didn't detect the libraries
refered to in $(LDLIBS) as being unused.
